		<div class="boxTitle" id="Chicken">Chicken</div>
		<div class ="boxText">Chicken is often a go-to protein, mostly because it's easy to cook and is considered a lean protein. Though chicken has a reputation for being bland, that couldn't be further from the proof. Whether you prefer juicy chicken thighs or tender chicken breasts, there are so many easy ways to dress the meat up and turn it into a winning meal. We recommend starting with this Tuscan Chicken Skillet. It's full of bacon, cream and Parmesan — is your mouth watering yet? There's no need to go out to dinner when you can make this restaurant-style creamy, cheesy chicken and fettuccine at home.</div>

		<div class="boxTitle" id="Beef">Beef</div>
		<div class ="boxText">There’s a reason beef has a regular place in our weekly meal plans (several reasons, actually!). Beef is an incredibly versatile and affordable option (depending on how you shop) that can be cooked into many different types of dinners. We all know ground beef can be easily turned into dozens of recipes, including burgers , stir-fries, and casseroles. If a meaty steak is what you’re after, it’s surprisingly fast to cook up on the stovetop. And large, tough cuts of beef, like a top round or chuck roast, are ideal for slow roasts and stews (preferably in the slow cooker or Instant Pot).</div>
